### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd J_kube
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```

## 🧪 Testing

J_kube includes comprehensive automated testing for key features, especially the connection and reconnection functionality.

### Running Tests

#### Standard Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:reconnection
npm run test:multiplayer
npm run test:edge
```

#### Automated Test Script
We provide a complete test automation script that handles the entire process:

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x run-reconnection-tests.sh

# Run the automated test suite
./run-reconnection-tests.sh
```

The automated script:
- Starts the server
- Runs all test suites
- Generates a detailed HTML report
- Manages the server lifecycle

#### Docker-based Testing
For completely isolated testing:

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x run-docker-tests.sh

# Run the Docker-based tests
./run-docker-tests.sh
```

This runs tests in a containerized environment for maximum consistency.

### Test Reports
Test reports are generated in the `test-reports` directory, including:
- HTML summary report
- Test logs
- Server logs
- Video recordings of test runs

For more details on testing, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
