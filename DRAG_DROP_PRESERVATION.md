# üõ°Ô∏è DRAG-AND-DROP FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION GUIDE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING
The drag-and-drop functionality in this codebase is **EXTREMELY FRAGILE** and has been the source of multiple critical bugs. **DO NOT MODIFY** any of the functions or code sections marked with `‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL` comments without first reading this entire document and following the preservation steps.

## üß™ MANDATORY TESTING
Before making ANY changes to drag-drop related code, you **MUST** run the comprehensive test:

```bash
CYPRESS_ENVIRONMENT=production npx cypress run --headed --spec "cypress/e2e/**/drag-drop-real-test*"
```

This test MUST pass 4/4 scenarios. If it fails after your changes, **immediately revert** and investigate.

## üîç CRITICAL COMPONENTS

### Server-Side (server-with-auth.js)

#### `updateBoard(newBoard)` Method - **NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY**
```javascript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY OR REMOVE - See DRAG_DROP_PRESERVATION.md
updateBoard(newBoard) {
  // Update the board with new arrangement
  this.board = newBoard;
}
```

**Why it's critical:**
- This method is called by socket handlers when clients perform drag-drop operations
- Removing it causes `TypeError: game.updateBoard is not a function` server crashes
- Server crashes break the connection, causing infinite client-side retry loops
- Must remain exactly as shown - even changing variable names can break functionality

**Historical note:** This method was missing from server-with-auth.js (while present in server.js) causing weeks of debugging before discovery.

### Client-Side (netlify-build/game.js)

#### Core Drag-Drop Handler Functions

##### 1. `handleTileDrop(dragData, targetSetIndex)` - **NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY**
- Used for simple tile drops (new sets)
- Called by `setupNewSetDropZone` and `setupBoardDropZone`
- Handles basic tile movement without position consideration

##### 2. `handleEnhancedTileDrop(dragData, targetSetIndex, insertPosition)` - **NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY**
- Used for precise positioning within existing sets
- Called by `setupSetDropZone`
- Handles complex tile insertion at specific positions

#### Drop Zone Setup Functions

##### 3. `setupSetDropZone(setElement, setIndex)` - **NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY**
- Sets up drag-drop for existing sets on the board
- Enables precise tile positioning within sets
- Calls `handleEnhancedTileDrop` for positioning

##### 4. `setupNewSetDropZone(newSetZone)` - **NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY**
- Sets up drag-drop for "Create New Set" zones
- Handles creation of new sets from tiles
- Calls `handleTileDrop` with targetSetIndex = -1

##### 5. `setupBoardDropZone(placeholderElement)` - **NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY**
- Sets up drag-drop for empty board placeholders
- Allows creating the first set when board is empty
- Calls `handleTileDrop` for new set creation

## üéØ DRAG-DROP FLOW ARCHITECTURE

### The Two-Path System
The drag-drop system uses two distinct paths:

1. **Simple Path**: New sets and empty board
   ```
   User drags tile ‚Üí setupNewSetDropZone/setupBoardDropZone ‚Üí handleTileDrop(-1)
   ```

2. **Enhanced Path**: Existing sets with positioning
   ```
   User drags tile ‚Üí setupSetDropZone ‚Üí handleEnhancedTileDrop(setIndex, position)
   ```

**Both paths are essential** - removing either breaks specific drag-drop scenarios.

### Socket Communication
Both paths ultimately emit `updateBoard` events to the server:
```javascript
this.socket.emit('updateBoard', { board: this.gameState.board });
```

The server then calls the critical `updateBoard(newBoard)` method.

## üö® COMMON FAILURE MODES

### 1. Server Crashes
**Symptom:** `TypeError: game.updateBoard is not a function`
**Cause:** Missing or modified `updateBoard` method in server-with-auth.js
**Fix:** Restore the exact method as shown above

### 2. Client-Side Infinite Loops
**Symptom:** Browser freezing, hundreds of console logs
**Cause:** Server crashes causing connection loss, client retries infinitely
**Fix:** Fix the server issue first, client will recover

### 3. Drag-Drop Not Working
**Symptom:** Tiles don't move when dragged
**Cause:** Missing or broken setup functions or handlers
**Fix:** Verify all 5 critical functions are intact and called properly

### 4. Positioning Errors
**Symptom:** Tiles go to wrong positions in sets
**Cause:** Confusion between simple and enhanced handlers
**Fix:** Ensure correct handler is called for each scenario

## üîß DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

If drag-drop breaks, check in this order:

1. **Run the test first** to confirm it's broken
2. **Check server logs** for `updateBoard` errors
3. **Verify server method exists** in server-with-auth.js
4. **Check client console** for socket connection errors
5. **Verify all 5 setup functions exist** and are called
6. **Test both simple and enhanced paths** separately
7. **Run the test again** after each fix

## üìã PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST

Before committing any changes that might affect drag-drop:

- [ ] All 5 critical client functions are intact and uncommented
- [ ] Server `updateBoard` method exists and is unchanged
- [ ] No modifications to socket event handlers for `updateBoard`
- [ ] Test passes: `CYPRESS_ENVIRONMENT=production npx cypress run --headed --spec "cypress/e2e/**/drag-drop-real-test*"`
- [ ] All 4 test scenarios pass (debug hand, infrastructure, initial play, all scenarios)

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Why This System is Fragile
1. **Multiple moving parts**: Client setup ‚Üí Client handlers ‚Üí Socket events ‚Üí Server method
2. **Two parallel paths**: Simple and enhanced handlers serve different use cases
3. **State synchronization**: Board state must stay in sync between client and server
4. **Authentication layer**: server-with-auth.js adds complexity vs. simple server.js
5. **Browser differences**: HTML5 drag-drop API behaves differently across browsers

### Previous Debugging History
- **Issue 1**: Missing `updateBoard` method in server-with-auth.js (took weeks to find)
- **Issue 2**: Function name conflicts between old and new handlers
- **Issue 3**: Infinite loops from `isMyTurn()` calls during connection issues
- **Issue 4**: Cache issues preventing updated code from loading
- **Issue 5**: Authentication token conflicts preventing proper testing

## üìû EMERGENCY CONTACTS

If drag-drop breaks in production and you need to revert quickly:

1. **Stable reference**: The `main` branch contains known-working drag-drop
2. **Working commit**: `200173b` - Contains the full working implementation
3. **Test command**: Always run the full test suite before deploying
4. **Rollback strategy**: Revert to main branch if all else fails

## üéØ FINAL WARNING

This functionality represents hundreds of hours of debugging and testing. The smallest change can break everything. When in doubt:

1. **Don't change it**
2. **Test extensively**
3. **Revert immediately if broken**
4. **Document any changes here**

**Remember: A working drag-drop system is worth more than a perfect one that doesn't work.**
